#Overview of the Process

The process for "reversing" the transport communications of these thick clients is as follows:

2.Obtain a copy of Burp  
3.Start Burp with admin privileges  
4.Add a Proxy Listener w/ Redirection and Invisible Proxying  
5.Connect to proxy listener as if it was a server  
6.Edit the host file and  C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts point to loopback address  
7.Use Burpe for forwarding
